
Stuff left TO DO in Pyrolite:

Java+.NET:
* more config items especially port numbers and hostnames
* implement array constructor based on machine type bytearray (_array_reconstructor, this is what Python3 uses to pickle array.array)
* implement memo-ing in the Pickler to be able to pickle recursive objects.
