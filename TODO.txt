
Stuff left TO DO in Pyrolite:

Java+.NET:
* more config items especially port numbers and hostnames
* implement memo-ing in the Pickler to be able to pickle recursive objects (note: unpickling works fine already).
* document type mappings from C#<->python
* port the array_reconstructor code from java to c#
